# Jekyll Demo

Blog-aware Website based on Jekyll
----------------------------------

Jekyll supports Markdown as well as HTML for pages; we can use it to construct layouts. Layouts are templates that wrap around your content 

## Git Branches:

1. master
2. gh-pages: gh-pages A special branch that is published on the web (hosting websites on GitHub). 

## What has been implemented

* Navigation
* Liquid as the templating language
* Posts and Pages
* Front matter used to set variables
* Permalinks and categories
* Use of custom layouts and include files
* Data file usage - Use YAML to store an array of navigation items each with a name and link.
* Use of Sass - A fantastic extension to CSS baked right into Jekyll.
 

To test the site locally:

From the root of project run the commands:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
